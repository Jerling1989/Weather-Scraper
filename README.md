# Weather-Scraper
I made this app to practice some basic backend coding with PHP. The app is built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX, and PHP. On the web app the user can search for the 3 day weather forecast in any city in the world. This is accomplished by using PHP and Regex to use the value of the user's form input entry to search a site for the weather and scrape the 3 day forecast. Then the data is added to an alert on the page using jQuery and AJAX.
